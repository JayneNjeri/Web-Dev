#Web Development
I have started amy web development journey thanks to PLP scholarship.
This is a simple project where i have created a portfolio with 3 pages, i.e, he index, about and homepages using html
This will be a build up of my portfolio where hopefully i will create an interactive and visually appealing portfolio
